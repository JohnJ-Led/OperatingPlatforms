Client- The Gaming Room
# Request:
Re-deveolop their current game "Draw It or Lose It" to be secure, and scalable to multiple client platforms./n
Current Platform - Android/n
Current Goals - Expand to new browser clients. (Safari, Google Chrome, MS Edge, ect)

# Successes:
Exisiting knowledge and usage of both Windows and Linux Servers gave better insight into the material at hand. This allowed for better recommendations. More expereince is needed, but overall the recommendations show a base knowledge of building and selecting an appropriate system for the clients needs.

# Development and Code
Unfortunately, a number of clarifing question exist on my end. These questions could have lead to a number of gaps in the document. More use of and increase moments to ask these questions in future projects would prove useful in building a written foundation of a full application and its needs.

# Revisions
I would revise the Distributed Systems and Networks. At this time a general understanding of network communication known, but not significant enough to provide solid input on a recomendation.

# User Needs and Implementation
For user needs I considered my own experiences with browser based game usage. This consist of minimized data usage, small browser size, and quick network responses. If a users need is not accounted for when developing a software, then the software could become an un-wanted and un-used product. Aside from how that would affect the client you are working for. As a developer or company being hired to create a product. Your own reputation is at stake and a reputation of building bad products will lead to no work.

# Approach
Approach of designing the software was based on personal experience. More hands on expereince is needed.More expereince working with a technical writer that can go into further detail of how to form a recommendation or how to evaluate and object is needed.
